I had the chance to work on many different technologies, front or back ones but never stopped getting interest in new emerging technologies. I'm still very specialized in web technologies and even have an official certification from Zend Technologies in PHP. I'm now mostly doing javascript in my work but I'm always open to learn new things.",
